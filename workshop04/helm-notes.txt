HELM
    package manager for kubernetes (like npm)
    charts is just a package
    provide a great reproducability (like docker)
    to deploy (i.e. called release in helm)
        helm install <myhelloworld_directory>
        helm rollback <release_name> #roll back to previous version if something's wrong
        * watch out for failed release, as if something went wrong while 
            releasing it will still be released
    
    helm install <repo_name> --name warehouse #release name
    helm delete --purge warehouse # to fully clean up
    * remember to change the version value in charts.yaml file
